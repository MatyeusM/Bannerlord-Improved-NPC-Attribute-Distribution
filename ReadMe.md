# Improved NPC Attribute Distribution Mod for Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord

## Overview
**Mod Name:** Improved NPC Attribute Distribution  
**Game:** Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord

## Why This Mod?
In the default game, NPC Attribute Distribution can be challenging, particularly for Wanderers who may not optimize their attribute allocation based on their skills. The existing taxicab metric often leads to bad decisions by the games systems, favoring attributes that might not align with logical skill priorities.

For instance, when comparing the choice between three skills at 50 and one skill at 120, any reasonable person would invest in the skill at 120. However, due to the taxicab metric's reliance, the game may incorrectly decide to allocate attributes to the three skills at 50, often favoring combat-related attributes.

This mod aims to rectify such issues by providing a more intuitive and balanced attribute distribution for NPCs, ensuring that their attribute allocations align more closely with skill priorities and result in more meaningful character development.

## Features

### Attribute Point Spending Models
Choose from different attribute point spending models:

* **Vanilla:** Retains the original game behavior, utilizing a taxicab metric for attribute distribution.
* **Vanilla Enhanced:** Slightly tweaks the Vanilla model by using a Euclidean metric (squared) for enhanced balance.
* **Optimized:** Removes balance considerations and directly invests in attributes needed, optimizing attribute allocation.

### NPC Base Attribute Points
Set predefined values for the amount of attributes any NPC has available at level 1:

* **Minimum:** 6
* **Weak:** 12
* **Vanilla:** 15
* **Player:** 18
* **Advanced:** 21
* **Strong:** 24
* **Super Human:** 27
